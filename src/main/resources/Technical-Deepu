Kubernetes:  Deploying and scaling containers.Container Orchestration S/w. Automating
deployment,scaling and management of containerized application.
Docker-deployfile.yml
If you have distributed application we need efficient communication between them 
seemlesly to build redundancy for each component.In order to achieve it we need to
containerize we create new pods of each component and application picks which pod to
communicate with -That's where K8s comes into picture.
yaml file contians
  Node:kubelet communicate with master,runs pods
  Pod:Runs 1+ Containers,exists on node
  Service:Handles requests,usually a LB
  Deployment:Defines desired state-K8S handles the rest.
  Spec:
    Containers:
      name: docker-k8s-demo
      image:deepthijava/docker-demo
      ports:
        containerPort:8080
  cmd: kubectl apply -f docker-k8s-demo.yml -This will deploy container to cloud
  
  
  
  Docker: Containerize(Package) application -[App+libs+etc]
  Open platform for devs and sys adimin to build ship and run distributed apps 
  whether on laptops.datacenter VM's or the cloud
  Package s/w in a format that can run isolated on a shared OS.
  Docker file-Build process for an image contains all commands necessary to build
  the image and run your application)
    from java:8
    expose 8080
    add target/docker-demo.jar docker-demo.jar
    entrypoint ["jave","-jar","docker-demo.jar"]
    
  Create image command: docker build -t docker-demo
  see images command: docker images
  push docker image: 
      docker tag docker-demo deepthijava/docker-demo
      docker push deepthijava/docker-demo
  Run and pull image
    docker run -p 8080:8080 deepthijave/docker-demo
    
   Microservices: Collection of softwares that are highly maintainable and testable,
   loosely coupled,independently deployed,organized around business capabilities,
   owned by small team
   Separate business logic functions,communicate via well defined API's-usually http
   
   Jenkins: Github webhook is used to push commit events to jenkins
   Github plugin: configured in jenkins-config system
   Github Ip's to be whitelisted on AWS Jenkins Security group
   Jenkins github config servers-Here do the config setup
   
   Update jenkins version: 
   Backup previous version war file by loggin in to Bitvise
      cmd: sudo -cp /../../
   Manage prepare mode-Restart jenkins
        cmd: sudo service stop
             sudo service start
    Then update jave version 
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
        
  Ansible:- Secrets vault management in vault.yml
  
   @RequestMapping(method="GET" value="\url" produces="application/json")
   @PreAuthorize(hasAuthority("ROLE ADMIN))
   @postAuthorize(hasPermission(return obj,:hasMatchingSubscriber" etc))
   Create custom annotation: 
        @Target({Type,field,Annotation-type})
        @Retention(RUNTIME)
        @Constraint(validatedBy=EmailValidator.class)-On variable
        
       Example:  public @interface validEmail(){ //This created @ValidEmail Annotation
          String message() default "Invalid email";
          class<?>[] groups() default{};
          class<? extendspayload>[] payload()
          }
          
  HTTP Response Status:
  1xx -Info Response
  2xx-Success
  3xx-Redirection
  4xx-Client Error
    400-Bad Req
    401-Unauthorized
    404-Not found
    408-Req Timeout
    440-Login timeout
    495-SSL
   5xx-Server error
    500-Internal Server Error
    502-Bad Gateway
    503-Service unavailable
    504-Gateway timeout
 
        
 Reflection API: (Manipulate classes and everything in class)       
  API which is used to examine or modify methods,classes,interfaces at runtime.
  Reflection gives us info about class to which an obj belongs and also the methods 
    of that class and which can be executed using obj
  We can invoke methods at runtime irrespective of the access specifier used in them.
  Adv: Extensibility feature(Appl can make use of external user defined classes
              by creating instance of extensibility obj using qualified names)
       Debugging and testing tools-Debuggers use to examine private methods of class
  DisAdv: Performance overhead
          Exposure of internals-(code breaks abstraction)

   Garbage Collection
   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/garbage-collection-java/
  Types of Garbage Collection
  What is the young generation?
    The Young Generation is where all new objects are allocated and aged. When the 
    young generation fills up, this causes a minor garbage collection. A young generation
    full of dead objects is collected very quickly. Some survived objects are aged and 
    eventually move to the old generation.
What is the old generation?
  The Old Generation is used to store long surviving objects. Typically, a threshold is 
  set for young generation object and when that age is met, the object gets moved to the old generation. 
  Eventually the old generation needs to be collected. This event is called a major garbage collection
What is the permanent generation?
  The Permanent generation contains metadata required by the JVM to describe the classes and methods used 
  in the application. The permanent generation is populated by the JVM at runtime based on classes in use 
  by the application.
