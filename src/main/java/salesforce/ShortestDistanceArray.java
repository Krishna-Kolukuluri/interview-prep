/**
Given an array of strings wordsDict and two different strings that already exist in the array word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

Example 1:
Input: wordsDict = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"], word1 = "coding", word2 = "practice"
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: wordsDict = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"], word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1

Time complexity: O(N \cdot M)O(N⋅M) where NN is the number of words in the input list, and MM is the total length of two input words.

Space complexity: O(1)O(1), since no additional space is allocated.
